1) In foc.c->MotorInit(): zero angle initialized using attached as5600 sensor.
   Implement as5600 object attached to each motor instance (unique I2C handler address)
   Check sensor connected and store zero startup angle.

2) HAL_GetTick() returns number of ticks since last reboot/startup, with each tick being 1ms.

3) Since timer ticks are unsigned int, there is no need to handle overflow since now - prev if now has overflowed will automatically correct.

4) Timer utils requires DWT_Init() to be called in main.

5) Added open loop velocity control. Function generates and updates the motor->params->el_angle param in each iteration based on the time elapsed and desired velocity.

6) Timer struct (htimx) added to Motor struct
   - NOTE: When accessing a member directly from a struct variable, use the dot (.) operator. Only use arrow (->) when accessing from struct pointer.
   - BUGFIX: motor->TIM_HandleTypeDef->Instance->CCR1 dosnt work. Must be TIM_HandleTypeDef.Instance->CCR1

1) Learn interrupts, attach interrupt to serial rx callback.
2) Implement serial commander function.

################################## UPDATES ##################################
20/1/25:
- Removed macros to set up motor structs; replaced with a function creating static structs on the stack.
- Motor & sensor object has to be manually created now, in main().

23/1/25:
- Updates naming of stucts to end with _t
- Added ReadRawAngle & ReadNormalizedAngle to AS5600.h
- Started on close loop position control function

25/1/25
- Renamed motor struct back to Motor (instead of Motor_t)
- Renamed SetPhaseVoltages to SetTorque
- Finished close loop position control function, yet to test

1/2/25
- PWM problem? Motor jiterry motion, and changing PWM duty cycle seems to have a pretty significant effect.
- Lower PWM frequency by setting prescalar.

5/2/25
- New PWM freq: 72Mhz / 256 / 8 = 35kHz (approx)

9/2/25
- Removed Kv parameter from Motor struct
- Tried to implement an auto calibrate function to find the pole pairs & sensor direction automatically
- I have no fucking idea what the problem is, but seems like the I2C dosn't work??
- Trying to print the encoder values just causes the program to freeze
- And this fucking cheap-ass stm32 board can't be debugged!!!!!

################################## BUGFIX & THINGS LEARNT ##################################
9/2/25:
- Fucking china stm32 boards dont work man. This shit a pain in the ass to debug

5/2/25:
- Finally found the problem!!! Apparently PWM frequency & resolution is quite significant. Changed the ARR to 256 (8-bit PWM) and prescalar to 8

24/1/25:
- Sine approximation function in timer_utils.c does not work as intended -- small angles always yield "0" as the output. Caused by type-casting error

20/1/25: 
- Remember to change header file funcion definitions after updating source file.

- When accessing a member directly from a struct variable, use the dot (.) operator. Only use arrow (->) when accessing from struct pointer.

- Motor struct timer updated to TIM_HandleTypeDef* pointer 

- Static inline functions defined in the source file are only accessible from within the file.
  Similarly, such functions should be fully defined in the header file (.h) as the compiler does not search for it's definition elsewhere.
  Hence, only small, short functions should be inlined.
  
- Static variables & structs could be created in functions and referenced even after function exit since they persist for the lifetime of the program.
